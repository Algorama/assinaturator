Assinaturator
==============
Signature generator


Aplication responsible for creating the signatures using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) and [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/).

Run the application
=====================
To properly run the application you are going to need a server with live reload capability.
You don't need to install any browser plugins or manually add code snippets to your pages for the reload functionality to work. You could use only [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).

```
npm install -g live-server
cd assinaturator/
live-server
```

If you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something even simpler, like the following Python-based one-liner:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
